    bio: 'Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is also one of the hottest. It has a very thin atmosphere.',
    info: "Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is a world of stark contrasts and intriguing mysteries. Named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury's rapid orbit around the Sun is a reflection of its swiftness in the sky. This small, rocky planet is characterized by extreme temperature variations and a lack of significant atmosphere, which together create an environment unlike any other in our celestial neighborhood. With a diameter just over one-third that of Earth's, Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. Its proximity to the Sun results in intense heat during its daytime, with surface temperatures soaring to a scorching 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius).",

    info: " Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is anything but a paradise. It is often considered Earth's closest celestial neighbor due to its similar size and proximity, yet its extreme conditions set it apart as one of the most inhospitable places in our cosmic neighborhood. Shrouded in a thick layer of toxic clouds composed mostly of sulfuric acid, Venus experiences a runaway greenhouse effect that results in surface temperatures soaring to a scorching 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius).",
